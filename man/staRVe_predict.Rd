\title{Predict from a \code{staRVe_fit} object.}
\usage{
staRVe_predict(x, locations, covariates, time = "model", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{staRVe_fit}.}

\item{locations}{Either an object of class \code{sf} containing point geometries,
or an object of class \code{RasterLayer}. This object should not have any
time information, as predictions will be made at each location at every time.
If a \code{RasterLayer} object, predictions will be made for all raster cells
whose value are not NA. If the raster has no values, then predictions will
be made at every cell. Raster predictions are made at the midpoint of each cell.}

\item{covariates}{Either a data.frame of class \code{sf} or a list of \code{Raster*}
 objects, depending on the input type of \code{locations}. If the model has
 no covariates, then nothing needs to be supplied.

 If \code{locations} is of class \code{sf} with point geometries, then
 \code{covariates} should also be of class \code{sf}. The data.frame should contain
 columns for each of the covariates, a column for the time index, and a column
 of point geometries. For each time unit and prediction point, there should
 be a row in the \code{covariates} data.frame, but the rows do not need to be
 in the same order as \code{locations}.

 If \code{locations} is of class \code{RasterLayer}, then \code{covariates}
 should be a list of \code{Raster*} objects. Each \code{Raster*} object should
 contain data for one covariate, should have one layer for each time unit,
 and should have the same raster geometry as the \code{locations} object. The
 layer names of each raster layer should be of the form \code{T####}, where
 \code{####} gives the specific time index. The geometry of all the
 \code{Raster*} objects should be identical.}

\item{time}{What time indices should predictions be made for? If set to "model",
predictions are made for every time present in the model.}

\item{...}{Extra options}
}
\value{
Either a \code{sf} object or a list of \code{Raster*} objects,
 containing predictions (with standard errors) for the spatial field, and the linear
 predictor on the link and response scales.
 The return type is the same as the type of input for \code{locations}.
